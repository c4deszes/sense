= Software architecture Design alternatives

== No aggregate

The Sensor Aggregator may be seen as a monolith pattern, the alternative would
be to wire each sensor to the modules that depend on it.

|===
|*Pro* | *Con*

|Monolith is avoided, in case of a new sensor only the dependent modules have to
be modified
|Too many dependencies having to be injected into the other modules
|===

== Merging Application Main with Signal Publisher

The Signal Publisher doesn't have many responsibilities therefore it could
be merged into Application Main.

|===
|*Pro* | *Con*

|Reduces complexity of the architecture
|Increases complexity of Application Main
|===
