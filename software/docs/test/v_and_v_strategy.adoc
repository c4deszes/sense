= Verification and Validation Strategy

== Process flow

=== Unit testing

Before integrating new software units they must be unit tested. Test driven
development may be used when developing new components.

[nomnoml]
....
[<start>st] -> [<state>Implementing unit]
[<state>Implementing unit] -> [<state>Implementing unit test]
[<state>Implementing unit test] -> [<choice>Passing?]
[<choice>Passing?]yes ->[<state>Reviewing unit & unit test]
[<choice>Passing?]no ->[<choice>Find failure source]
[<choice>Find failure source] failure in test -> [<state>Implementing unit test]
[<choice>Find failure source] failure in unit -> [<state>Implementing unit]
....

=== Qualification testing

Features are tested by qualification tests, the verification criteria shall be
defined when defining the requirements.

The tests are preferrably implemented before the feature is merged, in worst
case has to be completed when the sprint is over.

The process of testing feature is equivalent to unit testing process flow, except
the test is not required to be passing or be complete before the review.

== Test Methods

=== Unit testing

Each software component is tested via Unit tests. The interfaces are provided
by the test environment and the values being provided by the tester.

=== Qualification testing

The integrated software is tested in a hardware in a loop test environment

== Test allocation

All tests are automatically reexecuted on every software change.

== Exit criteria

All tests must be executed before a software release and the release report
shall contain the number of passing, failing and skipped tests.

There's no requirement on how many tests should pass.
