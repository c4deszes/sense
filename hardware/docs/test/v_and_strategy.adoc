== Test Methods

=== Static testing

The hardware schematic and layout are tested within the toolchain for common
eletrical __(ERC)__ and design errors __(DRC)__.

== Test allocation

Static tests are automatically reexecuted on hardware design changes. The rest
may be partially automated or manual, depending on the complexity.

== Exit criteria

All tests must be executed before a hardware sample release and the release
report shall contain the measurements.
