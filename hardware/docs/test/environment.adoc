= Test Environment

== Scope

- Power stage validation
- Anemometer driver circuit validation
- Temperature measurements
- Signal integrity check (I2C, UART signals)

== Instrumentation

=== Power supply

A programmable power supply is used to carry out measurements at different
input voltages.

=== Oscilloscope

An oscilloscope is used to check signal integrity.

=== DAQ

A Data acqusition unit is used to measure internal temperatures and validate
the internal signals of the anemometer circuit.

== Test framework
