== Sensor states

On power on reset each sensor shall start in *NO_INIT* state.

The microcontroller shall attempt to initialize each sensor individually then
based on the internal communication, peripheral states shall decide whether
the sensor is functional and assign either *INIT_OK* or *INIT_ERROR* states
accordingly.
