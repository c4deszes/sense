== Test Methods

=== Whitebox testing

Some internal signals can be observed through the diagnostic interface.
These will be used for measurements, because it's faster than doing data logging
over WiFi.

=== Blackbox testing

The product is tested through the interfaces that are also accessible to users.

== Test allocation

Some of the tests are automatically reexecuted on software, hardware, mechanics
changes and releases. The rest will be scheduled before a product release.

== Exit criteria

All tests must be executed before a product release and the release report
shall contain the number of passing, failing and skipped tests.

Safety, security and legal tests must pass before a product release.
