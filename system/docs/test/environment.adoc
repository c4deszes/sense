= Test Environment

== Scope

- Power compliance tests
- Operational temperature functional tests
- Anemometer accuracy measurement

== Out of scope

- WiFi communication, MQTT communication (tested in Software)
- Light, Dust incident measurement (measurements taken over from part manufacturer)

== Instrumentation

=== Power supply

A programmable power supply is used to test power compliance.

=== Serial device

A standard USB to Serial converter is used to communicate with the DUT over
the diagnostic channel.

=== TBD

Climate chamber, wind tunnel.

== Test Framework

JavaTMC is used for interaction with measurement instrumentation with
JUnit5 as the surrounding Test framework.
